2. DRAWING QUALITY OBSERVATIONS
   - Overall line quality (firm/hesitant/shaky/confident)
   - Pressure applied to the drawing tool
   - Presence of erasures, corrections, or revisions
   - Overall neatness and organization
   - Coherence and integration of elements

3. SIZE RELATIONSHIPS
   - Relative size of House, Tree, and Person to each other
   - Size in relation to page dimensions
   - Proportional relationships between parts

4. COLOR AND SHADING (if applicable)
   - Colors used for each element
   - Shading patterns and techniques
   - Color intensity and coverage
   - Color consistency across elements

5. PERSPECTIVE AND DEPTH
   - Viewing angle (frontal, profile, three-quarter view)
   - Depth cues (overlap, size, position)
   - Ground/baseline representation
